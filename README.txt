# CNN Tutorial Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

## Project Structure

- **cnn_tutorial_notebook.ipynb**: Contains the complete Python code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook cnn_tutorial_notebook.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to train the CNN and evaluate its performance on the MNIST dataset.

## Results

- The CNN achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset.
- Visualizations of training and validation accuracy are provided.
